# Machine Learning Facial Recognition

WARNING: MANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND LIBRARIES USED ARE MOST LIKELY OUT OF DATE

In order to teach myself a little bit about machine learning, I created the repository to recognize faces in a webcam/image and to have the machine write the person's name above their face. This is written in python 3.10 and implements libraries, such as cv2 and others included in the requirements file.

## How to Use:
- git clone https://github.com/K4iserK4rl/MachineLearningFacialRecognition
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- For now, use the command line to run the python files (EX: python facial_recognition_picture.py)

## TO-DO:
- [x] Create Web Scraper for Images
- [ ] Fix the webcam lag
- [ ] Create a larger dataset
- [ ] Finish the GUI
- [ ] Keep the code up-to-date (On-going)
